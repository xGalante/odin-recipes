        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>24 ounces (700 grams) ground beef mince</li>
        <li>10 ounces (300 grams) ground pork mince, or beef</li>

        <li>14 ounces (410 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 heaped tablespoons tomato paste, (I use garlic and herbs flavoured)</li>
        <li>2 beef or vegetable bouillon cubes, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon each dried oregano and basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar, (if desired)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, season to your tastes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>White Sauce (Béchamel):</h4>
    <ul>
         <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
         <li>1/4 cup flour, all purpose or plain</li>
         <li>3 1/2 cups milk</li>
         <li>1 cup fresh shredded parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Lasagna</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>13 ounces (375 grams) fresh lasagna sheets*</li>
        <li>17 ounces (500 grams) fresh mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h4>Meat sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, 
        then add in the onion and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, 
        or until softened. Add in the garlic and sauté for about 
        1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking 
        it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 
        crushed bouillon and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and 
        bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of 
        salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each) and 
        sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, 
        occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly 
        and meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Parmesan White Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. 
        Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for 
        about 30 seconds, or until well blended.</li>
        <li>Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low 
        and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. 
        Once well blended, add the remaining milk in 1 cup 
        increments, mixing well after each addition, until all 
        the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the 
        sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns 
        into a nice and creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce 
        while stirring occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes) 
        and coats the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. 
        Season with salt and pepper and mix until the cheese 
        is melted through.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F | 180°F.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 cup of meat sauce on the base of a 
            9x13-inch baking dish, then cover with lasagna sheets. 
            (Trim sheets to fit over the meat if needed.) Layer 
            with 2 cups of meat sauce (or enough to cover pasta), 
            1 cup of white sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat layers (leaving the remaining cheese for the top).</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining meat sauce and white sauce over the 
            last layer of lasagna sheets and top with the remaining 
            mozzarella cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and 
            bubbling.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and let stand for about 10 minutes 
            before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>ENJOY!</strong></p>
