    </ul>
    
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For the dough, pile the flours and 1 level teaspoon of sea salt 
    onto a clean surface and make a well in the centre.</li>
    <li>Add the yeast and sugar to 650ml lukewarm water, mix 
    together and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well.</li>
    <li>Using a fork and a circular movement, slowly bring in the 
    flour from the inner edge of the well and mix into the 
    water. Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour, when the 
    dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, 
    flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using 
    your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading 
    for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm 
    and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until 
    doubled in size.</li>
    <li>For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick 
    the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, 
    add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a 
    couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, 
    then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a 
    pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or 
    until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. 
    When the time is up, taste, and season to perfection.</li>
    <li>To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one 
    half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining 
    half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls.</li>
    <li>Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave 
    to rest for about 15 minutes,this will make them easier to 
    roll it thinly.</li>
    <li>Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or 
    semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick.</li>
    <li>Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it 
    with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place 
    the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the 
    remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile 
    them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.</li>
    <li>When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 
    250°C/500°F/gas 9.</li>
    <li>At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the 
    tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. 
    Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining 
    basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add 
    a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your 
    conventional oven, if not, cook them one by one on pieces of 
    tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards 
    the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas 
    on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too 
    big, otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre). Cook for 
    7 to 10 minutes, until the pizzas are golden and crispy.</li>
