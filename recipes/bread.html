    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Crusty homemade artisan bread is so easy to make with no 
        kneading required. soft on the inside with an irresistible 
        chewy crust!</em></p>
    <p>It looks too good to be true, I know. Fluffy, crusty bread 
        with no effort? No way. But ever since we first saw this 
        recipe a few years ago, we have been baking it just about 
        every week. Now you will too! Beginner bakers rejoice: 
        no intimidation needed!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FLOUR:</strong> Bread flour results in a softer, fluffier 
            bread because of the higher protein content. 
            Regular all purpose or plain flour also work really 
            well, with the texture changing only a little. If 
            using wholewheat flour, use about 1/4 cup less 
            flour and add more as you go, if needed.</li>

        <li><strong>SUGAR:</strong> Yeast feeds on sugar and starch, 
        the perfect pairing in bread dough. The mix releases carbon 
        dioxide gas, causing the bread to rise while baking. The 
        bubbles push the dough up and out, creating a soft and 
        spongy texture.</li>
        
        <li><strong>YEAST:</strong> We have tried this recipe over the 
        years with dried, instant and rapid-rise. We found the 
        dried yeast did not need activating before mixing it through 
        the dry ingredients. If hesitant, feel free to activate it 
        first in the warm water and oil for a couple of minutes 
        before adding the rest of your ingredients.</li>
        
        <li><strong>OIL</strong> is what makes our bread even softer. 
        You need this sneaky little addition for a silky, soft crumb.</li>

        <li><strong>WARM WATER</strong> Not too hot or it will kill your 
            yeast. 130°F or 55°C is the perfect temperature. You 
            can also do the finger test: if you dip your finger 
            in the water and its nice and warm, it’s perfect. 
            If it burns, let it cool down slightly until warm.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a large bowl. 
    Add water and oil, mixing to incorporate all of the 
    ingredients together. Dough will be wet, sticky and shaggy. </li>
    <li>Lightly spray the top with cooking oil spray. Cover with
     plastic wrap and place a dry tea towel over the top. </li>
    <li>Leave in a warm, draft-free place for 2-3 hours, until 
    doubled in size. Dough will have a lot of little holes or 
    bubbles and be wobbly like jelly. </li>
    <li>Place a large (10-inch or 26cm) dutch oven or 
    heavy based pot in the oven with a lid. Preheat 
    oven to 450°F (230°C) 30 minutes before baking.</li>
    <li>Lightly flour work surface and plastic spatula with up to 
    1 tablespoon flour. Scrape dough out of bowl onto work 
    surface with spatula. Sprinkle the top of dough with a 
    large pinch of flour and fold it over on itself with the 
    spatula (about 5-6 folds). Roughly form a round shape.</li>
    <li>Measure out a large piece of parchment paper, 
    large enough to transfer the dough into the pot. Place 
    paper next to the dough and roll dough onto the paper, 
    smooth side up. Carefully move it to the centre of the 
    paper and reshape if needed, or shake pan a couple of 
    times to evenly distribute dough. (It will even out while baking.)</li>
    <li>Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest while oven 
    is preheating. </li>
    <li>Use oven mitts to carefully remove hot dutch oven from oven. 
    Grab the parchment paper from each end to pick up the dough 
    and transfer it into the pot.</li>
    <li>Cover with lid and bake for 30 minutes, then remove lid 
    and bake for an additional 12-15 minutes, until loaf 
    is beautifully golden browned.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>ENJOY!</strong></p>
